# Paradisus-PublicDomain Releases

The objective of this project is to create brand-new free releases dedicated to the Public Domain.

We tend to prefer attending requests from fellow members from open forums such as DonationCoder or Reddit (though not limited to those two communities).

The main focus at this time is doing "Coding Snacks" for the DonationCoder.com community at their "[Post New Requests Here](https://www.donationcoder.com/forum/index.php?board=71.0)" section.

We are always thrilled to have steady sponsorship from members of the open source community who consider new releases as the very "gist" of the service the open source community gifts to the world.

Thanks for your consideration.
